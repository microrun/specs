# specs

This repository contains the schema definitions for all external microrun APIs:
 - `config` specifies the public API format of the microrun configuration files
 - `api` specifies the internal API used for communication between the CLI and the server daemon

The specs are being compiled into Go code located [here](https://github.com/microrun/specs-go).
